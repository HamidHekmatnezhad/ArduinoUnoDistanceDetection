# University Project: Distance Detection and Relay Activation System with Arduino Uno

This university project utilizes an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller to construct a distance detection and relay activation system. The system employs three **HY-SRF05** modules for distance measurement, an **Liquid LCD** for displaying information, and a **Relay Board** for output control.

### Functionality:
1. The system continuously measures the distance of objects or individuals using the HY-SRF05 modules.
2. If the measured distance falls below a specified threshold value, the system activates the relay.
3. The relay remains activated until the measured distance returns above the threshold or the on-time reaches a defined limit.
4. The system displays information on the LCD, including the distance, relay on-time, and a bar graph representing either the distance or the on-time.

### Applications:
* Security systems
* Access control systems
* Home automation systems
* Educational projects

### Advantages:
* Easy to use
* Low cost
* Customizable
* Expandable

### Required Components:
* Arduino Uno
* 1 HY-SRF05 modules
* 1 Liquid LCD
* 1 relay board
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard

### Construction Steps:
1. Connect the HY-SRF05 modules to the Arduino Uno.
2. Connect the LCD to the Arduino Uno.
3. Connect the relay board to the Arduino Uno.
4. Upload the Arduino code.
5. Test the system.
